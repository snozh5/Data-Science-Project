# Data Science Project
The projects in this repository are few of the academic project done for my diploma degree in Data Science.

#### 1. [Uber Assignment](https://github.com/snozh5/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Uber%20Assignment.ipynb)
<b>Objective:</b> The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and 
recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of the analysis, one should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible 
hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

#### 3. [House Price Prediction Assignment](https://github.com/snozh5/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Advanced%20Regression.ipynb)
<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this assignment is to find out the important variables that affect the price of the house and how those variables describe the price of the house.
All of these need to be done using Ridge and Lasso Regression technique.
